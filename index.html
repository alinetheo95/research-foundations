                        <p>In Anatomy of an AI, Kate Crawford performs a deep investigation into the lifecycle of creating an AI system, from the mining required for its extraction, to the end of its short life span in which it is discarded as waste. Crawford examines all the steps in between and the negative impact they have on the planet and the labor economy.</p>

                        <p>I’m interested in exploring water properties further, as well as networks, and visualizing the unseen.</p>

                        <p>In other classes I have been focusing on flooding in New York City subway stations, which have been increasingly flooding from heavy rainfall due to outdated infrastructure with insufficient capacity for water. I’ve been researching statistics of rainfall and flooding and visualizing it through mapping systems, as well as temporal and relational diagrams. I’m in the process of creating a water flow simulation in grasshopper which will take in the topography of New York City. </p>

                    <h2>Rhetorical Argument</h2>
                        <p>Understanding mycorrhizal networks is crucial to addressing climate change. These networks risk reduction and worsened conditions as effects of climate change.</p>

                        <p>Using the rate of relationships from other networks, we can draw conclusions on mycorrhizal networks and apply them to other systems.</p>

                        <p>Plants “learn” just like AI systems do. If we can take what we know about training AI systems and apply it to plant intelligence, we have the opportunity to produce a great extent of new discovery.</p>
