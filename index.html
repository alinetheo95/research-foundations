        <div class="details">
            <p>The futurism architectural movement predicted technological advancements being made to the physical environment, but the reality now is that the digital environments are evolving, while the physical environment is being left behind, and the physical infrastructure is suffering. In contrast to what the Futurists projected, we are dealing with a world that is suffering severely from climate change, even though scientists have been studying problems and coming up with solutions for years. In order for any type of solution to be achieved, governance and policy need to put climate mitigation at the forefront of their agendas, and we unfortunately live in a very polarizing society right now where people still do not believe in climate change or the impact it has. The trajectory I wish to continue is to spread awareness and spark reaction through art, while also making new research findings to invent a small-scale solution.</p>

            <p>Climate + Computation is the CDP based theme in which this project is situated. The relevant texts are Half-Earth and Atlas of AI, and common themes that have been discussed include concepts such as speculative climate futures, cybernetics, and half-earth socialism. At GSAPP, we have had countless discussions on the environmental consequences that computation can have, and has proven to have. So my question is what is computation’s role in making a better, more sustainable future?</p>

            <p>Because I am studying the relationship between the digital and the physical environments, I will be looking at augmented reality programming as a tool to study the intersection between the two. I’ll start by analyzing cell growth, both in physical and digital forms, comparing and contrasting their processes, relationships, and reactivities. I would also like to add projection mapping with digital visuals as another way to intersect the digital and physical environments, while adding the auditory element of music. I’d like to create an audiovisual environmental experience that is cultivating and emotional.</p>

        <div class="details">
            <p>The visual representation tools I’ll be using for the framework, initial analysis, and investigations will be relational diagrams and connective networks. I’m fascinated with the visual language of circuit boards and mechanical elements, as well as the physical properties of water flow, which I plan on bringing into the work. The end result will be an animated experience that incorporates the physical and digital environments, as well as audio visuals.</p>

        <p><b>Rhetorical Argument</b></p>
        </section>

        <div class="details">
            <p>I’ll be framing a conversation about the impacts that climate change has had on physical environments, including the natural and the built environments, while making the argument that artificial intelligence has the power and ability to produce solutions for climate change. Currently, the power of AI does not sit in the hands of the people who want to make a difference in climate change, so I would hope to be channeling the public as my audience in commuting this through graphics and a powerful experience, as well as researchers, scientists, and designers, who understand  the gravity of the situation and will hopefully be moved to make a difference in their own practices.</p>

        </section>

        <div class="details">
            <p>I’d like to expand upon the existing biotechnology research on the intersection of the natural environment with technology. I’ll be looking at electronic plants as a starting point, as those experiments are already underway. In parallel, I’ll be focusing on flooding in the New York City subway system, which I am in the process of developing custom analysis tools for. With flooding as the problem, and some sort of electronic plant as a potential solution, I’d like to combine the two in an exhibition format, with visuals and audio to accompany it to provide an experience.</p>

        <p><b>Challenges</b></p>
        </section>

        <div class="details">
            <p>It is easy to be optimistic in an academic setting because the real challenge for this project will be actual implementation. Even if these discoveries are possible, we’d have to be situated in a world that invests more time and money into the research of climate change interventions with AI. They are happening in small scales around the world, but not enough to reverse the damage that has already been done. My goal with this project will not necessarily be something that is practical or easy to implement, but rather an opportunity to study the power of what could really be achieved if this project existed in a best case scenario vacuum. Other than this major challenge, the smaller challenges I expect to face along the way will be improving my visual and technical skills in order to achieve this, as well as the scale at which I can pull off the final exhibition-scale presentation of the project.</p>
