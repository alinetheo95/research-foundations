Crawford examines all the steps in between and the negative impact they have on the planet and the labor economy.</p>

                    <h2>Rhetorical Argument</h2>
                        <p>Understanding mycorrhizal networks is crucial to addressing climate change. These networks risk reduction and worsened conditions as effects of climate change.</p>

                        <p>Using the rate of relationships from other networks, we can draw conclusions on mycorrhizal networks and apply them to other systems.</p>

                        <p>Plants “learn” just like AI systems do. If we can take what we know about training AI systems and apply it to plant intelligence, we have the opportunity to produce a great extent of new discovery.</p>

                        <p>For my capstone project, I’d like to expand upon the existing biotechnology research on the intersection of the natural environment and technology. I’ll be looking at examples of electronic and robotic plant experiments that are already underway and letting further research inform the direction of this project.</p>

                        <p>I’ll be making observations and collecting data to distinguish how these systems can be applied at larger scales, whether for climate change intervention, or other environmental benefits, depending on what further research shows.</p>

                        <p>In considering plant intelligence, I’ll be examining the way that natural systems react to different conditions and what we can learn from them.</p>
